### Leaning Page

The leaning page follows a more clean concept, with a cool and simple interface, making it easy to navigate through the site.
###
On this webpage, there are two animations: the "store" and the "buy now" buttons, that are triggered when hovered.

The "store" button shall redirect the user to the store page, where all the team's products will be displayed.
###
The "buy now" button will redirect the user directly to the jersey page, where they will be able to see more informations about it.
